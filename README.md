# Inspiration

For this project in pair programming we decided to go with a news website aggregator, where people can see the top news in the UK and read them in the place they were originally published. 

The design was inspired by "The New York Times", the website being in black and white.

# Getting Started

As we learnt through the course, it is best practice to start with a pseudocode.

So we had a wireframe to show how we wanted the website to look like, and the pseudocode with all the functionalities we wanted to add.

We used an API from where we could get the updated news.

First part was to make the homepage work with a few news and centering then in each box.

When the homepage was working just fine, we started with the other pages that we set to have, those was 'Businnes', 'Sports' and 'Entertainment'.

To set the other pages was easy, we just had to make something similar with the home page.

When the other pages were working perfectly, we decided to add a search bar.

That was the next step, when the search bar was working our job was done.

We only had 48 hours to finish this project, so the website don't have many functionalities, but it work very well and satisfies the NVP.
